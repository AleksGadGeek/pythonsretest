# Public Website (Hello World) - Python

This repository contains a simple Python web application that displays a "Hello World" message on a public website. The purpose of this project is to provide a basic template for creating a Python web application and deploying it on a public server.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Flask (Python web framework)
- Git (version control system)

## Steps to Create the Website

Follow the steps below to create and deploy the public website:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the command: `git clone https://github.com/AleksGadGeek/pythonsretest.git`

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**: Change into the project directory and create a virtual environment by running the command: `python3 -m venv env`. Activate the virtual environment using the command: `source env/bin/activate` (for macOS/Linux) or `env\Scripts\activate` (for Windows).

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies by running the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install Flask, the web framework used in this project.

4. **Run the Application**: Run the Python application using the command: `python app.py`. The application should now be running locally on `http://localhost:5000`. You can access this URL in your web browser to see the "Hello World" message.

5. **Deploy to a Public Server**: To deploy the website on a public server, you need to choose a hosting provider (e.g., Heroku, PythonAnywhere, AWS, etc.). Follow the specific deployment instructions provided by your chosen hosting provider.

6. **Update Website Content**: Modify the `app.py` file to update the content of the website. You can customize the "Hello World" message or add additional functionality as per your requirements.

7. **Commit and Push Changes**: Once you have made the desired changes, commit and push your changes to the remote repository using the appropriate Git commands.

8. **Monitor and Maintain**: Ensure that your public website is running smoothly by monitoring its performance and addressing any issues that arise. Regularly update the codebase as required to keep the website up-to-date.
